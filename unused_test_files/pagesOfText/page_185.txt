Pattern 34
Black to play and live
This shape  is simila r to those  you've  seen
thus  far, but the entire position has been
move d one space  to the left In additio n,
note  that Black also has played  a hane in the
corner. In this case as well,  the pecul iar
characteri stics of the corner  make them-
selves felt,  so Black can live.
Solution. The same technique
Just as in the last pattern,  the soluti on is
to make the open connection at Black  1
here. When  White cuts at 2, connecting at
Black 3 is probably something of a blind
spot  Black answers  White 4 by descend ing
to 5, and the trick is that White has no way
to push into the corner.
Failure. Connect ing at the base
If Black first  connects at 1, Whit e will
play  a hane at 2 and kill him.
Furthermore,  Whit e can also play 2 at 4,
but he must  be very  carefu l, because when
Black answers  at 3, if White cuts  at 'a',
Black will play  at 2 and live. If Black
begi ns with  1 at 4, White answers  at 'b'.
Reference.  The lifeline
Whe n this positio n arises, Black  1 be-
comes  the lifeline. If Black forgets  to make
the forci ng play at 1 and simply  makes the
open  connection at 3, White will cut at 'a'.
Now a black  play at 1 comes  too late. Black
is dead.
